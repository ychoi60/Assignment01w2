In 1948, Harry and Esther Snyder opened the first In-N-Out Burger.
 They served the freshest burgers, fries, and drinks in a friendly,
 sparkling-clean atmosphere. And the times, well,
 they have not changed at In-N-Out.
 The menu is still the same basic menu our guests have enjoyed since 1948.
 And we've been serving everything up the same exact way:
 fresh, made to order and with only the highest quality ingredients.
